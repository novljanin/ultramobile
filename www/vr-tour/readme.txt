Due to browser security restrictions, a web server must be used locally as well.
To see the tour you can use one of these 3 methods:
1) upload the files to a web server and access the corresponding url (http: //server.domain/folder/index.html)
2) use a local web server (like xampp, mamp, python http server, ...) and access the corresponding url (http://127.0.0.1:port/index.html)
3) the files are ready to be packaged as desktop application (mac, linux, windows) with electron (https://www.electronjs.org/)
